GUIDE:

	G1. Make sure you have a local server on your PC either xampp or wamp.
 	    If you don't have any, the run the xampp installer in resources/setup in this package to
  	    install xampp.
	    If you already have a local server on your PC, jump to G4,

	G2. After installation, move all of the whole folder 'todo' into htdocs inside the xampp root folder (i.e move inside C:\xampp\htdocs)

	G3. By default, the user that is configured for xampp server is 'root' with no password, you can go
	   ahead to create a more secured account (optional) by:
			i.   Go to the root of xampp that you installed (it is always in C:\xampp),
			ii.  Open the phpMyAdmin  folder (C:\xampp\phpMyAdmin),
			iii. Locate the config.inc.php script and open with an editor,
			iv.  create a user by editing the value of $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] in line 20 
			v.   create a password by editing the value of $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] in line 21
			vi.  Save the script and close. There you go! You now have a secured account. 
			


	G4. Open the php script config.php in resources/php in this package and edit the variables. If you have created an 
	   account in your server, input the created user and password. If not, leave the user to be 'root' with no password.
	   Also input any name for the database . Leave the host as '127.0.0.1'.
		
		NOTE: ALL THESE INPUT MUST BE IN EITHER SINGLE OR DOUBLE QUOTE

	G5. Now start the local server. To start the local server,
		i.  Run xamp-control located inside the xampp root folder (i.e C:\xampp)
		ii. start the Apache and mySQL by clicking the start button in front of each

	G6. When the local server has been started, then everything is set. To run the application, open any browser (preferably chrome),
	   enter the address 'localhost/todo' or '127.0.0.1/todo'.

	G7. You should have the application running fine by now.


		NOTE: This guide uses xampp, system of things and location of files might be different in other local servers.
